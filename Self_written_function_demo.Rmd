### Data cleaning

```{r }
data(ahp, package = "r02pro")
# raw <- data.frame(ahp[,apply(ahp,2,function(x) sum(is.na(x))==0)])
raw <- ahp
rapply(raw,class) %>% table()   # check the classes
unique_count(raw)   # check unique count in diff classes to decide threshold for factor dtype changing
# -> set threshold as 10
data <- raw %>%
  auto_dtype_change(chr_to_fct = T, fct_still_fct = T, date_to_num = T, 
                    fct_threshold = 10, drop_chr = T) %>%
  dummy_coding(except = "gar_fin") %>%   # except could be a outcome variable that we don't want to modify
  data_normalize(except = 1)             # except argument can also be col idx
str(data)
```
